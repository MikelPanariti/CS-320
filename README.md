Ensuring Functionality and Security:
- To ensure functionality, rigorous testing is essential. 
- Adopting a test-driven development (TDD) approach in Project One allowed me to create JUnit tests concurrently with code, validating that each feature met its requirements.
- For security, input validation is crucial. By incorporating robust validation checks in the Contact, Task, and Appointment services, I minimized the risk of potential vulnerabilities related to user inputs.

Interpreting User Needs:
- Interpretation of user needs involves effective communication and continuous feedback. In Project One, close collaboration with stakeholders and clear documentation of requirements facilitated a shared understanding of the expected functionalities.
- Regular user acceptance testing (UAT) and feedback loops were integrated, allowing for adjustments and enhancements based on user preferences and evolving needs.

Approaching Software Design:
- Software design is approached systematically, starting with a clear understanding of requirements. Dividing the system into modular components (Contact, Task, and Appointment services) allowed for focused and manageable design and implementation.
- Object-oriented principles were applied to enhance code reusability and maintainability. The design prioritized encapsulation and separation of concerns, contributing to a scalable and adaptable system architecture.
